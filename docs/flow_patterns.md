# Additional Agentic Flow Patterns

This document sketches several orchestration flows that the current code base does not yet implement. They are ideas for future exploration and expand the capabilities outlined in the existing architecture documents.

## 1. Event Driven Pipelines

Instead of invoking a pipeline directly, a lightweight watcher listens for external events such as webhook notifications, file changes or messages on a queue. When a matching event arrives it spawns a pipeline with the event payload as the initial input. This pattern allows agents to react continuously to their environment.

**Design Considerations**

- A long running watcher goroutine subscribes to the chosen event source.
- Each received event constructs a pipeline input map and calls `ExecutePipeline` in its own goroutine.
- Backpressure can be handled with a bounded work queue so bursts of events don't overwhelm the system.
- The watcher itself is an agent so different event sources can be plugged in by configuration.

## 2. Planner–Executor Loop

A planning agent accepts a high level goal and outputs a list of pipeline steps to achieve it. The orchestrator then executes these steps dynamically. After execution a feedback agent reviews the result and either marks the goal complete or generates a new plan. This cycle continues until success criteria are met.

**Design Considerations**

- The planning agent could leverage an LLM or rules engine to convert goals into step definitions.
- Planned steps are fed back into the orchestrator to produce a temporary pipeline at runtime.
- A simple state store tracks the goal, attempted plans and final outcome for transparency.
- Safety checks should validate generated steps before execution to avoid invalid or harmful actions.

## 3. Critic Feedback Flow

For quality sensitive tasks a separate critic agent evaluates the output of another agent. The critic can request a retry with modified input, escalate to a human or approve the result. The orchestrator coordinates this handshake so the primary agent only proceeds once the critic signals success.

**Design Considerations**

- Each critical step pairs a worker agent and a critic agent in the same pipeline group.
- The critic receives the worker output and additional context such as acceptance criteria.
- If the critic marks the result unsatisfactory the step is repeated with refined parameters.
- A maximum retry count prevents infinite loops and surfaces failures to the caller.

## 4. Collaborative Multi‑Agent Workspace

Some problems benefit from multiple specialised agents working together. In this pattern agents share a lightweight data store (for example a key/value cache) and post intermediate artifacts for others to consume. The orchestrator may launch several agents at once and periodically synchronise the shared state.

**Design Considerations**

- A simple in‑memory store or database table holds shared documents or messages.
- Agents update and poll the store through dedicated helper functions.
- Synchronisation points within the pipeline ensure agents see a consistent view before continuing.
- This approach enables tasks like distributed research or synthesis where agents contribute pieces of the final answer.

## 5. Human‑in‑the‑Loop Approval

Certain actions may require explicit user confirmation. A pipeline step can pause execution and emit a request for approval via email, chat or a web UI. Once approval is granted the orchestrator resumes from the next step.

**Design Considerations**

- The approval step stores its state so the process can survive restarts.
- A separate service or manual command posts the approval which unblocks the waiting goroutine.
- Timeouts and escalation paths ensure the pipeline does not hang indefinitely.

## 6. Streaming Data Flow

Continuous data streams such as log tailing or message queues can feed a long-lived pipeline. Agents consume items as they arrive and emit results back onto a second stream for downstream consumers.

**Design Considerations**

- Source and sink agents keep persistent connections open to the message bus.
- Backpressure is handled with bounded channel buffers or fan-out workers.
- Metrics around lag and throughput reveal when the stream is falling behind.

## 7. Dynamic Branching Pipeline

Rather than a fixed list of steps, earlier results determine which groups to execute next. This allows conditional flows or looping behaviour without a full planner.

**Design Considerations**

- Each step may return a branch identifier consumed by the orchestrator.
- Branch definitions live in a map so new paths can be added via configuration.
- Safe defaults ensure an unknown branch terminates gracefully.

## 8. Ensemble Voting

Multiple generation agents can produce candidate answers in parallel. An aggregator agent scores or ranks the options and emits the top choice or a blended result.

**Design Considerations**

- Agents run concurrently to reduce latency despite duplication of work.
- The aggregator may use simple majority voting or an LLM-based judge.
- Capturing all candidates aids auditing and future tuning.

## 9. Speculative Execution

When a step has several potential implementations, the orchestrator can launch them simultaneously and cancel the slower ones once a satisfactory result arrives. This trades some wasted effort for lower overall latency.

**Design Considerations**

- Cancellation requires each agent to respect context deadlines.
- The orchestrator monitors which task finishes first and prunes the others.
- This approach is best suited to idempotent operations like retrieval.

## 10. Checkpoint and Resume

For lengthy workflows the orchestrator periodically persists the `StepData` map so progress survives restarts or crashes. Execution can resume from the last completed group.

**Design Considerations**

- A durable store such as a database or object storage holds checkpoint files.
- Each checkpoint records the pipeline ID, group index and outputs so far.
- Cleanup policies remove old checkpoints once the pipeline succeeds.
=======
## 6. Real-Time Streaming Chain

Some tasks produce partial results that are useful before the entire step finishes. In this pattern each step streams its output through channels so downstream agents can begin work immediately. The orchestrator fans tokens or partial structures to consumers and aggregates their responses as they arrive.

**Design Considerations**

- Steps emit incremental messages instead of waiting for completion.
- Downstream agents buffer or merge streamed data in their own goroutines.
- Useful for LLM generation or realtime data transforms where latency matters.
- Channel backpressure or rate limits should prevent runaway streams.

## 7. Adaptive Model Selection

Rather than statically assigning a tool, the orchestrator chooses among multiple models based on runtime metrics. Agents report quality and latency which feed a scoring policy that selects the best provider for each request.

**Design Considerations**

- Agents advertise their capabilities and historical performance.
- The orchestrator records success rates and response times per provider.
- A policy engine or simple heuristic picks the model on a per-call basis.
- Fallback paths ensure progress if the top candidate fails.

## 8. Self-Healing Pipelines

Long running pipelines may encounter transient errors. A self-healing flow automatically retries with adjusted parameters or routes around failures before giving up.

**Design Considerations**

- Each step defines retry strategies and alternate execution paths.
- Persistent state allows recovery without repeating completed work.
- Diagnostic agents collect error context and suggest remedies.
- Final escalation to a human operator occurs after configurable limits.

## 9. Time-Scheduled Execution

Some workflows run on a fixed cadence, such as nightly data refresh or periodic reporting. A scheduler agent triggers pipelines according to cron-like rules.

**Design Considerations**

- The scheduler maintains a queue of upcoming jobs and spawns them in their own goroutines.
- Concurrency limits prevent too many runs from overlapping.
- Execution history supports auditing and troubleshooting.
- Missed schedules should be detected and optionally backfilled.

## 10. Skill Discovery Loop

When an agent lacks the knowledge to complete a task it can attempt to acquire a new skill on the fly. A meta-agent searches documentation or repositories for relevant examples and integrates them into the pipeline.

**Design Considerations**

- Retrieved code or instructions are validated in a sandbox environment.
- Successful integrations update the agent registry so future pipelines benefit.
- Progress tracking avoids repeated attempts to learn the same skill.
- Manual review steps may be required for high risk capabilities.

These patterns provide inspiration for extending the orchestration layer into more autonomous and resilient workflows.

## 6. Reflective Self-Improvement Cycle

A dedicated reflection agent reviews completed steps and suggests adjustments to the pipeline or step parameters. The orchestrator applies these suggestions and reruns the modified pipeline until the goal is met or a limit is reached.

**Design Considerations**

- Step results and logs are fed into the reflection agent as context.
- Proposed changes are validated before altering the running pipeline.
- A maximum iteration count prevents endless refinement loops.

## 7. Conditional Branching

Steps may emit a branch label that determines which pipeline group executes next. This allows the workflow to adapt at runtime based on intermediate results.

**Design Considerations**

- Pipeline configuration defines possible branches and their corresponding groups.
- A default branch handles unknown or missing labels.
- Branch decisions can depend on thresholds or classification agents.

## 8. Map-Reduce Fan-Out

For data-intensive tasks the pipeline can split input into chunks and run groups of agents on each chunk concurrently. A reduce step then merges the partial results.

**Design Considerations**

- The orchestrator replicates groups for each data chunk using goroutines.
- A combine agent aggregates outputs into a single result.
- Chunking logic and final merging strategy must be configurable.

## 9. Progressive Context Summarization

Long-running flows risk accumulating too much context. A summarization agent periodically condenses intermediate state so later steps operate on manageable input sizes.

**Design Considerations**

- Summaries may be stored in the vector store or passed directly to later steps.
- The summary length and frequency can be tuned per pipeline.
- This pattern enables iterative reasoning without overwhelming token budgets.
=======
## 6. Speculative Branching

When a task has multiple potential approaches the pipeline can "branch"
into several candidate steps executed in parallel. A later aggregator
chooses the best result based on scoring or voting. This allows rapid
exploration of alternatives such as different prompts, retrieval
strategies or tool selections.

**Design Considerations**

- Each branch is defined as its own pipeline group so all variations run
  concurrently.
- An aggregator agent collects the branch outputs and picks the winner
  using custom logic (ranking, majority vote, etc.).
- Optional early cancellation stops slower branches once a strong result
  is found.

## 7. Progressive Summarisation

Long documents or streams can be summarised in multiple passes. Initial
agents create short summaries of chunks of text which are then combined
by a higher level summariser. The final summary is more coherent and can
scale to large inputs.

**Design Considerations**

- Chunk‑level summariser agents run concurrently for efficiency.
- Intermediate summaries are stored in a shared location for the next
  summarisation step.
- Multiple rounds of summarisation can be configured depending on the
  input size.

## 8. Self‑Healing Pipelines

Pipelines handling real traffic may encounter transient failures or
suboptimal results. A monitoring agent observes metrics and errors then
adjusts parameters or restarts steps automatically.

**Design Considerations**

- Agents publish success and failure metrics to a central monitor.
- A supervisor agent alters step configuration or triggers retries when
  thresholds are exceeded.
- Step‑level timeouts and health checks are required so unhealthy steps
  can be detected reliably.

## 9. Model Ensemble Voting

For generation tasks involving LLMs, the same prompt can be sent to
multiple models in parallel. A voting agent selects the final answer
based on ranking or heuristics, reducing reliance on a single provider.

**Design Considerations**

- Generation agents run concurrently so model latencies overlap.
- The voting agent may weight models differently or perform additional
  quality checks.
- The orchestrator should support configurable ensemble sizes and
  fallbacks.
